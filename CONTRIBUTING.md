## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool      | Version |
| --------- | ------- |
| Node.js   | 20+     |
| pnpm      | 9+      |
| Turso CLI | latest  |
| Git       | any     |

### Local setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nuxflow.git
cd nuxflow

# Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment template
cp apps/nuxflow/.env.example apps/nuxflow/.env
# Edit .env — the file:// SQLite URL works for local dev without Turso

# Run migrations
pnpm --filter @nuxflow/db migrate

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/setup` to complete onboarding.

### Useful commands

```bash
pnpm test           # unit tests (all packages)
pnpm test:watch     # unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:e2e       # Playwright e2e (requires running dev server)
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript across all packages
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm build          # production build
```

## Branch & Commit Conventions

### Branches

```
feat/short-description      # new feature
fix/short-description       # bug fix
docs/short-description      # documentation only
chore/short-description     # tooling, dependencies, config
refactor/short-description  # refactor with no behaviour change
test/short-description      # tests only
```

### Commit messages

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) via `commitlint`.

```
feat: add webhook retry backoff
fix: correct S3 signature generation for non-standard regions
docs: update plugin authoring guide
chore: bump drizzle-orm to 0.46
refactor: extract auth token validation into shared util
test: add form submission integration tests
```

Breaking changes use a `!` suffix or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat!: rename TURSO_URL env var to NUXT_TURSO_URL
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Open an issue first** for any change larger than a typo or a trivial bug fix. Discuss the approach before writing code.

2. **Fork and branch** from `main`.

3. **Write tests** for all new behaviour (see [Writing Tests](#writing-tests)).

4. **Check types and lint** before pushing:

   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm lint
   ```

5. **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR. Refactors belong in a separate PR.

6. **Fill in the PR template** completely.

7. Maintainers review within ~3 business days. Address review comments with new commits (do not force-push a reviewed branch).

---

## Writing Tests

### Unit tests (Vitest)

Unit test files live next to their source files and are named `*.test.ts`.

```bash
pnpm test              # run all
pnpm test:watch        # watch mode
pnpm --filter @nuxflow/db test   # single package
```

### Integration / API tests

Use `@nuxt/test-utils` for Nitro handler tests. Mount the Nitro app, hit endpoints, and assert responses.

```ts
import { setup, $fetch } from '@nuxt/test-utils/e2e'

describe('content API', async () => {
  await setup({ rootDir: '../../apps/nuxflow' })

  it('returns 401 without auth', async () => {
    const res = await $fetch('/api/v1/content', { method: 'GET' })
    expect(res.status).toBe(401)
  })
})
```

### E2E tests (Playwright)

E2E tests live in `tests/e2e/` and require the dev server to be running:

```bash
pnpm dev &
pnpm test:e2e
```

---

## Building a Plugin

### Scaffold

```bash
npx nuxflow create-plugin my-plugin
cd packages/plugins/my-plugin
pnpm install
```

### Manifest (`nuxflow.plugin.ts`)

```ts
import { defineNuxFlowPlugin } from '@nuxflow/plugin-sdk'

export default defineNuxFlowPlugin({
  name: 'My Plugin',
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'What this plugin does.',
  permissions: ['read:content', 'send:email'],
  adminMenuItems: [
    {
      label: 'My Plugin',
      to: '/admin/my-plugin',
      icon: 'i-lucide-puzzle',
    },
  ],
})
```

### Structure

```
packages/plugins/my-plugin/
├── nuxflow.plugin.ts       # Plugin manifest (required)
├── nuxt.config.ts          # Nuxt module entry point
├── server/
│   └── api/                # API routes (prefixed automatically)
├── app/
│   └── pages/admin/        # Admin pages
├── components/             # Vue components
└── package.json
```

### Rules

- **No `node:*` imports** — the plugin runs in Cloudflare Workers. Use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) instead of `node:crypto`, and `fetch()` instead of `node:http`.
- **No dynamic `require()`** — use static `import` only. Nitro bundles statically.
- **No in-memory state** — Cloudflare Worker isolates do not share memory between requests. Use the database.
- **Declare all permissions** — users approve them before activation.
- **Catch your errors** — the plugin loader wraps plugin setup in a try/catch, but individual route handlers must handle their own errors.

## Building a Theme

### Scaffold

```bash
npx nuxflow create-theme my-theme
cd themes/my-theme
pnpm install
```

### Structure

```
themes/my-theme/
├── nuxt.config.ts              # Nuxt layer config (required)
├── components/
│   └── blocks/                 # One component per block type
│       ├── Paragraph.vue
│       ├── Heading.vue
│       ├── Image.vue
│       └── ...
├── layouts/
│   └── default.vue             # Public site root layout
├── pages/                      # Theme-specific page overrides
├── assets/                     # CSS, fonts, images
└── package.json
```

### Block component contract

Each block component receives a `block` prop:

```ts
interface Block {
  type: string
  attributes: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

Example `Paragraph.vue`:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  defineProps<{ block: { attributes: { content: string } } }>()
</script>

<template>
  <p class="my-4 leading-relaxed" v-html="block.attributes.content" />
</template>
```

### Publish

Publish your theme as an npm package and open a PR adding it to the NuxFlow theme registry (documented in `specs/`).

## Architecture Notes

### Cloudflare Workers constraints

All server code (API handlers, middleware, plugins, utilities) runs in the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Key restrictions:

| Not allowed            | Use instead                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `node:crypto`          | `crypto.subtle` (Web Crypto API)      |
| `node:fs`              | `fetch()` / Turso client              |
| `require()` dynamic    | Static `import`                       |
| In-memory Map/state    | Turso DB (shared across isolates)     |
| Long-running processes | Cron via Cloudflare scheduled workers |

### Database

All queries must be scoped to `event.context.site.id`. Do not write queries without a `siteId` filter — cross-site data leakage is a critical security issue.

### API conventions

- Use `parseBody(event, schema)` (Zod) for all request bodies.
- Use `requireRole(event, 'admin')` or `requireAuth(event)` at the top of every protected handler.
- Return errors with the `response.ts` helpers (`notFound()`, `unauthorized()`, `validationError()`).
- All mutations should call `writeAuditLog(event, userId, { action, resource, resourceId, before, after })`.

### Multi-site isolation

Every database table that stores site-specific data has a `site_id` column. The `server/middleware/site.ts` middleware resolves the current site from the `Host` header and attaches it to `event.context.site`. All handlers use `event.context.site.id` — never hardcode a site ID.
