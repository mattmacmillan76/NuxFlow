### Minor Changes

- d8bd19a: feat: role/permissions security audit — close cross-tenant access gaps, add admin UI role gating, super admin management, and whole-database export

  **Authorization (security)**

  - `requireAuth()` now rejects a user with no role row on the current site (403) instead of silently granting a default `'viewer'` — user accounts are global across a multi-tenant install (no `siteId` on `users`/`accounts`) and login has no site-membership check, so any account anywhere in the instance could previously get baseline read access to another site's admin data (drafts, private/members-only content, media library, revisions) just by authenticating on that site's domain. Super admins keep their documented cross-site `'viewer'` fallback; only genuine strangers are rejected.
  - The same gap existed in API-key auth: removing a user from a site only deletes their `user_site_roles` row, not their API keys, so a revoked user's still-valid key kept working at `'viewer'` level indefinitely. `03.api-key-auth.ts` now leaves the key unresolved (same as an unrecognized one) when its owner's role row is gone, instead of defaulting to `'viewer'`.
  - All 7 AI generation routes (`generate-content`, `generate-canvas`, `improve`, `grammar`, `seo-suggest`, `translate`, `alt-text`) required only a valid session — any authenticated user, including a self-registered `'member'`, could burn provider API spend. Now require `'editor'`, matching the two sibling AI routes that already did.
  - All 3 menu mutation routes (create/update/delete) required only a valid session — any authenticated user could edit site navigation, including the header/footer, and trigger a full public-page cache purge. Now require `'editor'`, matching every other content-mutation route.
  - `PATCH /api/v1/users/:id` blocked an admin from touching a super admin's role but not their own — an admin could self-demote with no confirmation, and if they were the site's last admin, no recovery path short of a super admin from another site. Blocked, mirroring the existing DELETE guard; the role dropdown is also disabled for your own row in the UI now.

  **Admin UI**

  - New client-side role gating: `app/utils/admin-nav.ts` is the shared source of truth for each section's minimum role, consumed by the sidebar (hides links a role can't use) and a new global route guard (redirects direct navigation to a friendly `/admin/forbidden` page instead of a silent failure).
  - New `POST`/`DELETE /api/v1/users/:id/super-admin` — promote/revoke a super admin without running someone through the full site-setup wizard (which also reseeds the site's content as a side effect).
  - `GET /api/v1/users` now reports a `pending` flag (never logged in) per user; `POST /api/v1/users/:id/resend-invite` re-sends the set-password email.
  - Self-registration now triggers a best-effort verification email (send capability wired up, not yet enforced — no `requireEmailVerification` flag, since every existing account in every existing deployment has `emailVerified=false` and a hard block would lock out current users the moment this ships).

  **New: whole-database SQL export**

  - `GET /api/v1/admin/db-export` (Admin → Super Admin → Database) generates a standalone, restorable `.sql` dump of every table across every site in the D1 instance — `wrangler d1 export` is CLI-only and unreachable from a live Worker, so this reimplements the idea via `sqlite_master`/`PRAGMA` introspection. Gated by `requireSuperAdmin`, not the site-scoped `requireRole` the per-site backup uses.

  **Per-site backup**

  - Theme CSS and dynamic plugin code — previously KV-only, silently missing from the JSON backup — are now included and restored (plugin code is re-verified by checksum + signature + trust pinning on restore, and a plugin id collision with another site's install now skips cleanly instead of crashing on a raw SQL constraint error).

## 2.0.0-beta.15

### Minor Changes

- 4d5024a: feat: complete the Paddle checkout flow via the Transactions API

  `POST /api/v1/memberships/checkout` never actually worked for Paddle — it built a URL to
  `/checkout?product=...&user_id=...&site_id=...`, a page that didn't exist anywhere in the
  app, so a Paddle subscribe click had nowhere to go. `PaddleProvider` already had a working
  `createTransaction()` method wired up to Paddle's real Transactions API; it just wasn't
  being called.

  The checkout route now calls `paddle.createTransaction()` and redirects to the hosted
  checkout URL Paddle returns — the same pattern already used for Stripe's checkout session
  and Lemon Squeezy's checkout, so `Paywall.vue`/`MembershipsBlock.vue` needed no changes at
  all (they already just do `window.location.href = url`).

  - `createTransaction()` now accepts a `returnUrl`, passed as the transaction's
    `checkout.url` so Paddle redirects back after a successful payment.
  - `customData` now includes `site_id` alongside `user_id`/`tier_id` — Paddle copies
    `custom_data` onto the subscription it creates, which the webhook handler's
    `assertWebhookSiteMatch()` (see the security-sweep changeset) now requires.
  - Corrected stale comments/docs in `payments/types.ts` and `CLAUDE.md` claiming Paddle
    checkout "is not API-driven" — it now is, same as Stripe and Lemon Squeezy.
  - Added a Paddle test flow to `docs/payments-setup.md`, matching the existing Stripe/LS
    sections.

- e79152b: fix: close 8 vulnerabilities found in a full-codebase security sweep

  **Authorization**

  - `PATCH /api/v1/users/:id` no longer lets an `admin` demote or reassign a `super_admin`'s role on that site — the guard already present on the equivalent `DELETE` route was missing here.
  - `POST`/`PATCH /api/v1/content` now require `editor`+ to set `status: 'published'`/`'scheduled'` directly — an `author` (the floor for content-write access) was previously able to self-publish unreviewed content, matching the guard already enforced for the MCP `update_content` tool.

  **Dynamic plugins**

  - The `/_nuxflow/ext/{pluginId}/*` proxy now forwards only an explicit allowlist of headers to plugin Workers (Content-Type, Accept, etc.) instead of the full incoming header set — it previously forwarded `Cookie`/`Authorization` verbatim to third-party plugin code, which only needs a self-signed Ed25519 key to install.
  - The Worker Loader cache key now includes `siteId` — two unrelated tenants installing byte-identical plugin code could previously share the same spawned Worker instance (and whatever in-memory state a prior request left behind).

  **Canvas / stored XSS**

  - Added `safeHref()` (scheme allowlist, matching the existing `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:` guard in `render-tiptap.ts`) and wired it into every link-bearing block prop (Button, Hero, CTA, Footer, Pricing, GDPR banner, Calendar) — these bound straight to `:href` with no scheme validation, unlike the `richtext`/`html` fields which already went through an XSS-filter sanitizer.

  **Payments**

  - New `assertWebhookSiteMatch()` — every Stripe/LemonSqueezy/Paddle webhook must now carry a `siteId`/`site_id` in its signed payload metadata matching the site the request resolved to (via the `Host` header) before any subscription row is written or cancelled. A valid provider signature only proves the payload came from that provider using _some_ site's configured secret, not which tenant it was meant for; two sites sharing a provider account/secret could previously have a webhook meant for one site applied to whichever site the request's Host header resolved to.

  **Theme CSS**

  - `sanitizeThemeCss` now decodes CSS escape sequences (`\75rl(...)` → `url(...)`) before stripping `url()`/`@import`/`expression()` — closes an escape-based bypass of the CSS attribute-selector exfiltration guard.

  **CLI**

  - `nuxflow plugin/theme deploy --site <url>` now refuses a non-`https://` site URL (except localhost/loopback) — it previously sent the admin email/password/session cookie in the clear over whatever scheme was given.

## 2.0.0-beta.14

### Minor Changes

- 931f3a6: feat: full-page HTML edge cache for public pages

  The public JSON data layer (`withEdgeCache`) was already cached via Cloudflare's Cache API, but the actual rendered HTML page was not — every visit re-ran the full Vue SSR render even on a cache hit for the data behind it. This adds a second cache layer that skips rendering entirely on a hit.

  - New `server/middleware/07.page-cache.ts` (read side) checks the Cache API before any routing/rendering happens; a hit replays the saved HTML and headers directly.
  - New `server/plugins/page-cache.ts` (write side) hooks Nitro's `render:response` to save the final rendered HTML after a cache miss.
  - New `server/utils/page-cache.ts` is the single source of truth both sides share for what's eligible to cache. Only anonymous, default-locale, non-admin/API/asset `GET` requests qualify — determined by an explicit cookie _allowlist_ (only the `@nuxtjs/i18n` language-redirect cookie, and only at the site's default locale) rather than a denylist, so a future cookie from some other feature or plugin defaults to "don't cache" rather than risking a personalized response being served to someone else. (Verified against the live site: every first-time visitor picks up that language cookie automatically, so gating on "zero cookies" alone would have made the cache almost never fire past a visitor's first page view.)
  - `purgeContentCache` (`edge-cache.ts`) now also purges the rendered page path(s) for a content change, not just the JSON path — including mapping the homepage content item's slug (`home`) to its real URL (`/`).
  - New `purgeAllPublicPages()` handles the cases where a single change affects _every_ cached page (a full page's HTML now has the site's shared chrome baked in, unlike the JSON layer) — wired into site/appearance settings changes, header/footer menu edits, and theme activation/CSS/customizer/reset. Runs in the background via `waitUntil` so it never slows down the admin action that triggered it.
  - Renumbered `server/middleware/redirects.ts` → `05.redirects.ts` and `theme-preview.ts` → `06.theme-preview.ts` so Nitro's filename-order middleware loading puts them (correctly) before the new cache check — an unnumbered file sorts after any digit-prefixed one, which would have let a newly-added redirect get shadowed by a stale cached page.

  Verified locally end-to-end via `wrangler dev`: confirmed MISS → HIT on a repeat request, confirmed `/admin` and `/api` routes are never touched by this cache, and confirmed a request carrying an unrecognized cookie neither reads from nor writes to it.

- 931f3a6: feat: pre-release security, correctness, and Cloudflare-native architecture audit

  A full audit pass across the codebase before first release, covering security, payments correctness, data integrity, and making better use of Cloudflare-native primitives. Grouped by area:

  **Security**

  - `02.multi-site.ts`'s domain self-heal (auto-updates a site's stored domain to match the live request host) now requires an authenticated admin+ session on that site — previously any unauthenticated request to `/admin/*` with a forged `Host` header could silently hijack a site's domain on a Worker with no custom-domain route configured.
  - `setup/complete.post.ts`'s secondary-site token claim is now one atomic conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE setupTokenHash = ?` instead of a read-then-write — closes a race where two concurrent requests holding the same (e.g. leaked) token could both become `super_admin`.
  - New `safeFetch()` / `resolvesToPrivateIp()` in `security.ts` — resolves a URL's hostname via DNS-over-HTTPS and re-validates on every redirect hop before the WordPress importer or backup media-fetch paths touch it, closing a DNS-rebinding gap in `isSafeUrl()` (which only inspected the literal hostname string).
  - `00.migrate.ts`'s migration-lock loser now polls for the winner to actually finish (bounded) instead of assuming success after ~1s and serving requests against a possibly-unmigrated schema.
  - `exif.ts`'s accessor helpers (`rational`/`getShort`/`getLong`/`getRational`) are now bounds-checked by construction — previously safe only because the one caller happened to wrap the call in try/catch.

  **Payments correctness**

  - The public content gate now requires `currentPeriodEnd > now()` in addition to `status = 'active'` — access no longer outlives a stalled or dropped webhook (a failed card during dunning used to leave full access indefinitely).
  - `upsertSubscriptionFromWebhook` is now one atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, backed by a new unique index on `subscriptions(site_id, provider, provider_subscription_id)` — closes a race where two webhook deliveries for the same checkout (Stripe always sends both `checkout.session.completed` and `customer.subscription.created`) could create duplicate subscription rows and double-send the activation push.
  - Stripe's secondary subscription-details fetch now throws (502) instead of silently swallowing a failure and returning 200 — Stripe will retry a transient failure properly now instead of it being lost.

  **Rate limiting**

  - Replaced the two-tier (isolate-memory + KV-or-D1 read-then-write) rate limiter with a single atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... RETURNING` against D1 — closes a TOCTOU race where concurrent requests for the same key could all read the same pre-increment count before any write landed, letting the effective limit be exceeded by roughly the number of in-flight requests every window. Isolate memory is now purely a fast-fail cache for already-confirmed-blocked keys, not the source of truth.

  **Cloudflare-native architecture**

  - New `R2Provider` (`media-providers/r2.ts`) — Cloudflare's own object storage, zero egress fees, no third-party account, accessed via an optional `MEDIA_BUCKET` bucket binding. Slotted into `getActiveProvider()`'s priority chain right after Cloudflare Images. Configurable in Settings → Media.
  - Theme CSS is now stored under a versioned KV key (`themes.cssVersion`, bumped atomically on every publish) instead of a fixed one — closes a staleness window where a publish could take up to ~2 minutes to become visible everywhere, from isolate-local CSS caching compounding with KV's own eventual-consistency propagation lag. Includes a backward-compatible fallback to the pre-versioning key so themes published before this change don't go dark.
  - The dynamic-plugin WorkerLoader cache key is now the plugin's stored code checksum instead of its free-text version string — a code-only fix shipped via `nuxflow plugin update` without a version bump now actually takes effect instead of continuing to serve stale cached code.
  - New hourly `reconcile-stuck-videos` task sweeps `video_assets` rows stuck at `status: 'processing'` past a 2-hour TTL; the video registration endpoint now requires a real successful Cloudflare Stream lookup before inserting a row at all, instead of silently inserting one that could never leave that state.

  **Data integrity**

  - New unique index on `content_taxonomy_terms(content_item_id, term_id)` — nothing previously stopped a duplicate assignment from double-counting an item in taxonomy archives.
  - `rate_limits` and `notifications` are now swept by the nightly `prune-old-data` task (previously unbounded).
  - Content autosave no longer snapshots a revision when title/content didn't actually change; `GET .../revisions` is now capped at 50 results.
  - Backup/restore now routes settings through `saveSetting()` (fixes stale-cache and broken re-encryption-on-restore bugs from bypassing it) and batches the content-restore existence checks into one query instead of one per item.
  - `sitemap.xml` / `sitemap-images.xml` are now bounded instead of unbounded.
  - The FTS5 `search_index` update trigger now only fires its reindex on the columns that actually affect it (title/excerpt/status/visibility), instead of on every single content edit.
  - Fire-and-forget notifications in `contact/submit` and `content/[id].patch` now use `ctx.waitUntil()` instead of risking silent cancellation when the isolate is reused before they finish.

  **Frontend bundle size**

  - The admin page-builder editor (`CanvasContentEditor`, pulling in `vuedraggable` and friends) is now a lazy async component instead of shipping to every public-page visitor via a universal client plugin.
  - `highlight.js` (core + 11 language grammars) now loads only when a page actually has a code block, instead of eagerly on every navigation.
  - `CanvasBlockImage` now lazy-loads, matching its `CanvasBlockGallery` sibling.
  - `feed.xml`'s hand-rolled TipTap serializer now blocks `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:` URL schemes in links and images, matching the sanitization the canonical web renderer already had — closes a gap where a malicious link/image URL was neutralized on the page but passed through unmodified into the RSS feed.

  **Also fixed**: a block-registry regression introduced (and caught before release) during this same pass, where a collision guard meant to stop a plugin from squatting a built-in block id also rejected the built-ins' own bootstrap registration — every block on every page fell back to its loading skeleton. `register()` now only rejects an id that's _already_ registered, relying on built-ins always registering first (synchronously, at boot) to win that race.

### Minor Changes

- 8125207: feat: purge the edge cache on write instead of relying solely on TTL expiry

  `withEdgeCache` (public pages, posts list, taxonomy archives, menus, site metadata, sitemaps, feeds, `llms.txt`) was TTL-only with no invalidation on write — up to an hour of staleness for the page route specifically (`/api/public/pages/:slug`, 3600s), and up to 5 minutes for the others. A content edit updated the database instantly but the public page a visitor saw could lag behind by that full window, which is a real problem for a CMS's core "publish and see it live" workflow — surfaced directly while diagnosing an unrelated styling bug, where a database fix was correct but invisible on the live site for up to an hour.

  New `purgeEdgeCache()` / `purgeContentCache()` in `server/utils/edge-cache.ts` delete the relevant cached entries immediately after a successful write, via the same Cloudflare Cache API `withEdgeCache` reads from. Wired into:

  - Content create/update/delete — purges the item's own page, the blog index, sitemaps, feeds, `llms.txt`, and any taxonomy archive pages it's tagged under
  - Taxonomy term reassignment — purges the item's page and its (new) tag/category archives
  - Menu create/update/delete — purges that menu's location (header/footer/sidebar)
  - Settings — purges site metadata on any site-level or settings change

  The TTL stays in place as a ceiling on staleness for anything the purge logic doesn't cover (e.g. a paginated archive page beyond the first), but the common "I just published/edited this" path is now near-immediate rather than capped at the TTL window.

## 2.0.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- df03d1f: fix: install and register `@tailwindcss/typography` so canvas text blocks render with real default styling

  `CanvasBlockText.vue` wraps sanitized rich-text content in `.prose prose-gray dark:prose-invert` — Tailwind Typography's naming convention — but the plugin was never actually installed or registered in `main.css`, so those classes have never had any CSS behind them, in any version of this project. Content that depended on inline `style` attributes for its visual design (e.g. `style="text-align:center"` on a `<p>`/`<h2>`) rendered correctly anyway _until_ `sanitize-html.ts`'s XSS whitelist — which deliberately strips `style` from block-level text tags as a CSS-injection guard, only `span`/`mark` may keep it — started being exercised on a fresh deploy, at which point the content fell back to the `.prose` wrapper's (nonexistent) styling and rendered as unstyled, left-aligned text.

  Fixed by installing `@tailwindcss/typography` and adding `@plugin '@tailwindcss/typography';` to `apps/nuxflow/app/assets/css/main.css`. This restores sensible default heading/paragraph/list styling for all canvas text blocks site-wide. It does not restore the exact original inline-style-driven design (e.g. centered uppercase eyebrow text) for content that relies on `style` on `p`/`h1-h6` — that sanitizer restriction is intentional and shouldn't be loosened; content needing that level of control should use `span style=""` (which the sanitizer allows) or a dedicated block/utility class instead.

## 2.0.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- 809058d: fix: register `@nuxflow/canvas` as an explicit Tailwind `@source` so its utility classes aren't dropped from the build

  `@nuxflow/canvas` is a plain workspace dependency, not a Nuxt layer, so Nuxt UI's automatic per-layer `@source` generation never covered it. This silently dropped any Tailwind utility class used only inside `packages/canvas/src/**/*.vue` (and nowhere in `apps/nuxflow/app`) from the compiled CSS — surfaced after the Nuxt UI v4 upgrade as visibly broken styling across canvas-rendered pages (e.g. the homepage hero CTA buttons losing their padding and one of their two utility-class-driven visual states). Verified by diffing the live site's compiled CSS against the component source: classes like `px-7`, used only in `CanvasBlockHero.vue`, were entirely absent from the bundle, while classes shared with `apps/nuxflow/app` templates still worked (since those got picked up incidentally via the app's own scanned files). Fixed by adding an explicit `@source '../../../../../packages/canvas/src/**/*.{vue,ts}'` directive to `apps/nuxflow/app/assets/css/main.css`, per Tailwind v4's documented pattern for monorepo workspace packages outside the CSS entry point's own directory tree.

## 2.0.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- 65d07ae: feat: upgrade @nuxt/ui v3 to v4, add Cloudflare agent skills, consolidate server audit/pagination helpers

  **Nuxt UI v3.3.7 → v4.11.0**

  - `@nuxt/ui` bumped in `apps/nuxflow/package.json` and `packages/canvas/package.json` (dependency, devDependency, and peerDependency)
  - Nuxt UI v4 unifies the former paid `@nuxt/ui-pro` into the single free `@nuxt/ui` package under MIT — confirmed via the package's `LICENSE.md` and `ui.nuxt.com`'s own FAQ, so this closes out the licensing review from the earlier Pro→free migration for good (no separate Pro tier can be reintroduced by accident)
  - The Headless UI → Reka UI / Tailwind Variants rewrite happened in the v2→v3 jump, which this project had already adopted, so v4's actual breaking changes (Pro package rename, `UButtonGroup`→`UFieldGroup`, `UPageMarquee`→`UMarquee`, `UPageAccordion` removal, `.nullify`→`.nullable` modifier, `UForm` nested-form changes) had zero footprint here — verified by a full usage audit before upgrading
  - Verified with lint, typecheck, the full unit (233) and integration (304) suites, and a live `wrangler dev` + Playwright E2E pass covering login, the admin dashboard, content list, and media library

  **Server API cleanup**

  - New `batchWithAudit()` helper in `server/utils/audit.ts` replaces the `db.batch(auditInsert ? [...writes, auditInsert] : writes)` ternary that was duplicated across 44 mutation routes
  - New `countRows()` helper in `packages/db/src/queries/paginate.ts` replaces the repeated `db.select({ total: sql\`count(\*)\` })` one-liner across paginated list routes
  - Fixed `forms/[formIdentifier]/submissions.get.ts`, the one paginated list route that wasn't using the shared `paginate()` helper and so never returned a `total` count

  **E2E test fix**

  - `loginAsAdmin()` test helpers (`auth-flow.spec.ts`, `membership.spec.ts`, `admin-content.spec.ts`) used a loose `getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i })` locator that ambiguously matched both "Sign in" and "Sign in with Passkey" — fixed to an exact match

  **Cloudflare agent skills**

  - Added `cloudflare`, `wrangler`, `workers-best-practices`, `cloudflare-email-service`, `web-perf`, and `turnstile-spin` to the vendored `.claude/skills`/`.agent/skills` (mirrored, project had zero Cloudflare-specific skill coverage before this)

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [65d07ae]
  - @nuxflow/canvas@2.0.0-beta.5

## 2.0.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- 07eeb51: Reduce D1 round trips on hot request paths, replace the Argon2 WASM hasher with a pure-JS implementation, and land a verified `better-auth` 1.7.2 upgrade with its account-identity migration.

  **Performance — fewer D1 round trips**

  - `server/middleware/02.multi-site.ts`: per-isolate 30s cache for the domain → site lookup (`clearSiteCache()` invalidates it on the self-healing domain-migration write), so every request no longer pays a D1 round trip just to resolve the current site.
  - New `server/utils/appearance-cache.ts` and `server/utils/theme-cache.ts`: same per-isolate caching pattern for resolved appearance settings and the active theme, kept in their own modules so mutation routes can invalidate them without importing the Nitro plugin files that own the SSR injection hooks.
  - `server/utils/audit.ts`: `writeAuditLog()` split into `buildAuditLogInsert()` (returns the query unexecuted) + a thin wrapper. Mutation routes across content, comments, taxonomies, menus, redirects, API keys, media folders, and memberships now fold the audit-log insert into the same `db.batch()` as the primary write instead of a separate awaited round trip.
  - `server/api/public/pages/[slug].get.ts`: content-type, author, and translation-source lookups (independent of each other) now run via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially.
  - `server/utils/media-providers/index.ts`: all candidate provider settings (Cloudflare Images, S3, Bunny) are resolved in parallel up front instead of one `resolveSetting()` await at a time.

  **Admin UI**

  - `app/pages/admin/content/index.vue` and `app/pages/admin/media/index.vue`: paginated "load more" list loading instead of fetching everything at once.

  **Security / dependency audit**

  - `workers/argon2-hasher`: replaced the `argon2-browser` WASM binary (unmaintained since 2022, plus a build step that reverse-engineered its minified Emscripten export names) with `@noble/hashes`'s audited pure-TS/JS Argon2id. Hash/verify round-tripped, benchmarked (~180ms at OWASP cost params), and confirmed against a live `wrangler dev` sign-in against the real database — no format change, existing password hashes keep verifying.
  - `better-auth` / `@better-auth/passkey` upgraded `1.6.22` → `1.7.2`. This version scopes OAuth account identity by `(issuer, accountId)` instead of `providerId` alone — added the required `issuer` column + backfill migration (`packages/db/migrations/0004_volatile_revanche.sql`) and fixed four hand-rolled account-insert call sites (setup wizard, public `/register`, demo reset, integration-test seed helper) that were bypassing Better Auth's own account-creation API. Verified the multi-domain `trustedProxyHeaders`/`allowedHosts` setup is unaffected by 1.7's stricter default, since it already opts in explicitly.
  - `@onmax/nuxt-better-auth` stays pinned to its `alpha` dist-tag — the `0.1.2` stable release has a confirmed typecheck regression unrelated to auth itself (breaks `$fetch` method-literal inference for any API route with a `GET` handler co-located with other methods at the same path). See `CLAUDE.md`'s "Auth and permissions" section for the full investigation and what's blocking the bump.
  - Removed a dead `pnpm.overrides` entry (`better-call>zod`) that no longer matched anything in the dependency tree.
  - Routine version bumps: `drizzle-kit`, `ulid` (aligned across `@nuxflow/app`/`@nuxflow/db`), `@tiptap/*`, `stripe`, `wrangler`/`@cloudflare/workers-types` (argon2-hasher worker), and the Nitro `compatibilityDate`.

## 2.0.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- ff1aa18: refactor: standardize server API error/validation helpers, add missing audit logs, and remove dead code

  Server API routes now consistently use the existing `response.ts` helpers (`notFound`, `forbidden`, `conflict`, etc.) instead of hand-rolled `createError()` calls, and the existing `parseBody`/`parseQuery` Zod helpers instead of `readValidatedBody(event, schema.parse)` — the latter previously surfaced bad input as an unhandled 500 instead of a clean 422. Thirteen mutation routes (taxonomies, comments, API keys, redirects, menus, media folders, memberships) that were silently skipping the audit log now write one, matching their sibling routes.

  Extracted repeated Drizzle query patterns into shared helpers: `getContentItemOrThrow`/`getContentTypeBySlugOrThrow` in `server/utils/content-queries.ts`, `getUserSiteRole` in `permissions.ts`, and `parsePagination` in `server/utils/pagination.ts` — the last of which also fixes a real bug where `forms/[id]/submissions.get.ts` was missing the `page >= 1` guard the other paginated endpoints had, producing a negative DB offset on `page=0` or negative. `contact/submit.post.ts` now reads its notification email through `resolveSetting()` instead of a raw query that bypassed the settings cache and decryption path.

  Also removed dead code found during the audit: an unused Pinia `useContentStore`, an orphaned/stale `searchIndexSql` export duplicating the real FTS5 migration, and an unused `canvasManifest` export in `@nuxflow/canvas`. Consolidated the duplicated block-definition fallback chain (`getBlockDefinition() ?? registry.getDefinition()`, which had already drifted between call sites) into one `resolveDefinition()` helper shared by `useCanvas.ts` and `NuxBlocks.vue`, and merged the app's `NuxBlockData` type with `@nuxflow/canvas`'s `CanvasBlockData` instead of maintaining two identical shapes by hand.

## 2.0.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- 59e0152: feat: self-service site deletion with main/addon-aware blocking

  Settings → Danger Zone's delete button called the wrong endpoint (the super-admin cross-site route, which explicitly refuses to delete the site you're currently viewing) and had no error handling, so it silently 409'd on every attempt. Added a proper self-service `DELETE /api/v1/settings` endpoint scoped to the caller's current site.

  In a multi-site install, deletion is now aware of which site is "main" (the oldest one — there's no separate flag for it): deleting the last remaining site resets to fresh-install onboarding as before, but deleting the main site while other sites still exist is blocked with a 409 and the list of sites that must go first (shown in the UI up front, not just as an error after clicking). Deleting an addon site is a full delete like any other — an earlier iteration kept the row around in a reset state to hand back an instant new setup link, but that left it permanently counting as a "blocking" sibling for the main site, so it's a straightforward delete now; re-provisioning an addon domain goes through the normal Super Admin → Sites → New flow.

  Every successful delete now signs the admin out: a session cookie for a domain that no longer has any site is meaningless, and doesn't carry over to the admin's other domains anyway since they're separate origins with separate cookie jars, not subdomains of one parent. Lands on `/setup` or `/login` depending on whether it was the last site, after a brief countdown so the confirmation is actually readable.

  Also restricts the multi-site single-site-fallback's domain self-heal to `/admin` traffic only. Previously any request to an unmatched host — including a bot hitting `/robots.txt` — could silently reassign the sole site's stored domain away from its real production domain if a second, never-onboarded domain was also routed to the same Worker.

  `docs/multi-site.md` documents both site-deletion paths (Super Admin → Sites cross-site vs. Settings → Danger Zone self-service) and the main/addon blocking behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 0bccc08: fix: Cloudflare Email binding rejects a from address with no display name

  `sendViaCloudflareEmail` always sent `from: { email: from }` — an `EmailAddress` object with no `name` key. Cloudflare's `send_email` binding validates that object stricter than its published types suggest (`name` is marked optional) and rejects it with "Incorrect type for the 'name' field on 'EmailAddress'" when `name` is absent entirely. There's no display-name setting to attach here, so `from` is now passed as a plain string instead — `SendEmailMessage` already supports that shape, and it sidesteps the broken object entirely. This also fixes the same bug in the password-reset email path, which shares this function.

  Also corrects `docs/installation.md`'s Cloudflare Email section, which conflated the `wrangler.toml` binding (already ships with NuxFlow, deployment-wide, nothing to add) with `wrangler email sending enable <domain>` (a genuinely per-domain step) into one instruction, and overstated the latter as a hard requirement — sends go through without it, so it's now framed as recommended for deliverability (SPF/DKIM) rather than mandatory, and called out as needed once per site's sending domain in a multi-site install.

- dda2bf4: fix: onboarding Enter-key on site name and Cloudflare-first email defaults

  Step 1 (site name) was the only onboarding field with no `@keyup.enter` handler, so Enter silently did nothing there while it worked one step later on the admin-account step.

  Also traced the Email step: nothing in onboarding actually depends on email working (no verification email or password-reset email is ever sent during setup — the wizard's provider choice only seeds the `email.provider` site setting, identical to configuring it in Settings afterward). Given that, it's safe to lead with the zero-setup option: defaults to `cloudflare` instead of `console`, and drops the dev-only Console entry from the onboarding picker (still available in Settings → Email for local dev use).

- 94b71bc: fix: restore Nuxt UI semantic color slots and migrate off raw color names

  `nuxt.config.ts` registered a custom `ui.theme.colors` list (`['green', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'gray']`) that silently replaced Nuxt UI's built-in semantic slots instead of extending them — only `primary` and `neutral` survive an override like this, so `secondary`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, and `error` were dropped project-wide. Every "danger/success/info" UI element in the app had been written against the raw color names instead, since that was the only palette that actually worked — a fragile, undocumented side-channel with no guarantee the module keeps generating CSS for it. One of these (the Danger Zone delete button) had already silently lost its styling entirely and rendered with no visible color.

  Restored the semantic slots and migrated ~190 call sites (buttons, badges, alerts, toasts, and a couple of local `Color` type unions) across the app to use them (`red`→`error`, `green`→`success`, `blue`→`info`, `yellow`→`warning`, `gray`→`neutral`). `orange` has no semantic equivalent and stays registered as a genuine custom color in the few places it's used for a distinction that isn't error/success/warning/info.

### Patch Changes

- f54d33e: fix: PATCH /api/v1/settings now writes an audit log entry

  This endpoint saves payment provider keys, AI provider keys, and (as of this
  session) per-site Google/GitHub OAuth client secrets, but never wrote an audit
  log entry — unlike every sibling mutation endpoint (content, media, users,
  themes). Found during a security review of this session's auth changes: the
  new OAuth-secret write path made this a higher-value target than before, with
  no record of who changed a credential or when. The audit entry records which
  setting keys changed, never the values, since several of them are secrets.

## 2.0.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 923e369: fix: stop fragmenting the Better Auth instance cache by port on production domains

  The per-host Better Auth instance cache introduced for per-site OAuth credentials was
  keyed by the full `Host` header (including port) for every request, not just local dev.
  Production's baseURL/allowedHosts computation doesn't depend on the request's exact Host
  string, so this only forced unnecessary rebuilds (extra D1 round-trips) on real domains —
  but during the narrow window right after a fresh site is created, those extra rebuilds
  increased exposure to a D1 read-timing race, intermittently producing an `allowedHosts`
  list that didn't yet include the new site's domain and causing session validation to fail
  right after sign-in (login would briefly succeed, then immediately bounce back to /login).
  The cache key is now hostname-only for real domains; the full host (with port) is kept
  only for local `wrangler dev`, where it's actually needed for WebAuthn origin matching.

- a60be5d: fix: production login succeeding then immediately bouncing back to /login

  Sign-in worked and correctly set a secure session cookie, but the very next page's
  server-side session check (`@onmax/nuxt-better-auth`'s internal SSR self-fetch, which
  runs on every page load) would silently invalidate it and redirect back to /login —
  even on a hard refresh, since the failure happened server-side during SSR, not in the
  browser.

  Root cause: Nitro dispatches this kind of internal self-fetch without forwarding the
  real `Host` header, defaulting to `localhost` — even inside a fully deployed production
  Worker. `buildBetterAuthInstance()` was branching `baseURL`/cookie-protocol on the
  current request's Host header, treating `localhost` as "we're in local dev" and
  switching to a plain string `baseURL` that dropped the `protocol: 'https'` pinning.
  That flipped Better Auth into non-secure-cookie mode for that one internal check, which
  made it look for the session under the wrong cookie name, fail to find it, and clear
  every session cookie — sabotaging the request that had just legitimately signed in.

  Whether this is a local dev deployment is now determined once from the deployment's own
  `sites` table (a local install's site domain is always `localhost`, which production
  never is) instead of from any single request's Host header, so real requests and
  internal self-fetches always resolve identically. Passkey origin/rpID still uses the
  per-request Host for local-dev WebAuthn correctness, since passkey ceremonies only ever
  originate from a genuine browser request, never Nitro's internal self-fetches — so that
  part isn't exposed to the same inconsistency.

## 2.0.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 0fc8497: feat: per-site social login credentials, unified Better Auth session validation, and local-dev passkey fix

  **Per-site Google/GitHub OAuth credentials**

  - `server/utils/better-auth.ts` now resolves `auth.google_client_id`/`auth.google_client_secret`/`auth.github_client_id`/`auth.github_client_secret` via `resolveSetting()` (per-site DB override first, deployment-wide env var fallback second) instead of reading env vars directly — the same pattern already used for media/email/AI/payments credentials
  - The Better Auth instance cache is now keyed per `Host` header (previously a single shared slot) so different sites sharing a Worker isolate never see each other's OAuth credentials, and a credential change on one site doesn't invalidate every other site's cache
  - New "Social Login" card in Admin → Settings → Integrations for entering per-site Google/GitHub client ID and secret, with redirect-URI hints computed from the site's own domain
  - `server/api/v1/settings/index.get.ts`/`index.patch.ts` extended to read/write the four new setting keys; secrets are masked on read and AES-GCM encrypted at rest via the existing `SENSITIVE_SETTING_KEYS` mechanism

  **Auth session validation unification**

  - All remaining `getUserSession`/`requireUserSession`/`serverAuth` call sites (the `@onmax/nuxt-better-auth`-provided helpers, which resolve a second, type-scaffolding-only Better Auth instance) migrated to `getAuthSession`/`requireSession` from `server/utils/auth.ts`, which are backed by the one real instance that actually serves `/api/auth/**`. Closes the last gap from the earlier session-validation-drift fix.
  - Removed now-confirmed-dead code from `server/auth.config.ts` (`sendResetPassword`, `account.accountLinking`, real `socialProviders` values) — that instance never receives real auth traffic, so this logic was unreachable; only the `socialProviders` provider _keys_ are kept, since the client's `signIn.social()` provider-name type is inferred from them

  **Local-dev passkey origin fix**

  - Passkey (WebAuthn) registration and login were silently broken in local `wrangler dev` since the dev server stopped running through `nuxt dev` on port 3000: the code's `isDev` branch relied on `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, but `wrangler dev` always builds with `NODE_ENV=production`, and the fallback `config.public.siteUrl` resolves to workerd's own loopback bind address rather than the browser's actual origin — either one causes the browser to reject the WebAuthn ceremony with a SecurityError before any request is sent. The RP origin/rpID (and dev-mode `baseURL`) are now derived from the incoming request's own `Host` header instead.
  - The per-host auth-instance cache key now uses the full `Host` header (not just the hostname) so an occasional port-less request doesn't get cached and served to later, correctly-ported requests for the rest of the 5-minute TTL.

  **Misc**

  - Page `<title>` order swapped to `{site name} | {page title}` (was `{page title} | {site name}`)
  - `docs/multi-site.md` and `docs/installation.md` updated for per-site social login setup

## 2.0.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 19df24f: fix: eliminate the dual Better Auth instance that caused site-wide 401s ("Authentication required") on every protected route while `/api/auth/**` itself kept working

  **Root cause:** the app has always had two separately-configured Better Auth instances — `server/utils/better-auth.ts` (hand-built, actually handles every `/api/auth/**` request and rate-limiting) and `server/auth.config.ts` (via `@onmax/nuxt-better-auth`, used only by that module's own `requireUserSession`, which every `requireAuth`/`requireRole` check went through). Each instance independently derives its own `baseURL`/protocol/cookie-naming from the request, so a session issued by one only validates correctly if the other happens to agree — which they silently stopped doing after an unrelated edit to the origin-detection logic in both files, breaking `notifications`, `settings`, `themes`, and every other protected endpoint in production while `get-session` kept returning 200.

  **Fix:** added `requireSession(event)` in `server/utils/auth.ts`, backed directly by `getOrCreateBetterAuth()` — the same instance that already handles `/api/auth/**` — so there is exactly one source of truth for session validation. Repointed `requireAuth`/`requireSuperAdmin` (`permissions.ts`) and 5 direct call sites (account/subscription, memberships checkout/billing-portal, users/me) from the module's `requireUserSession` to this helper. `server/auth.config.ts` is kept only because `@onmax/nuxt-better-auth` needs it to bootstrap client-side composables (`useUserSession()` etc.); nothing server-side reads session state from it anymore, so this class of drift is no longer possible. Widened `getOrCreateBetterAuth`'s cached-instance type (it was narrowed to `{ handler }` only) so `.api.getSession()` typechecks. Added a matching `globalThis.requireSession` stub to the integration-test harness.

  Also includes, from the same working session:

  - `server/utils/pw.ts`: the Argon2 service-binding hasher now catches hash/verify failures and falls back to scrypt with a warning, instead of the failure propagating unhandled.
  - `server/api/v1/setup/complete.post.ts`: the initial-setup path can now re-run against a domain that already has a site record (clearing previously-seeded content/settings/roles first) when the site or user table is empty, supporting a clean re-setup after a D1 wipe without deleting the database by hand.
  - `docs/multi-site.md`, `CLAUDE.md`: documented the one-time setup-token link flow for adding secondary sites (introduced 2026-06-02) — previously undocumented, which was the direct cause of a support question this session. The docs now cover copying the full `?token=...` URL, why the bare domain 403s, and that a failed attempt doesn't burn the token.

- e4d1b14: refactor: eliminate fake "bundled plugins", promote canvas blocks to core, squash migrations

  **Architecture cleanup — bundled plugins removed**

  - Deleted `packages/plugins/` entirely (contact-form, html-block, payments, and the old canvas copy)
  - Canvas package moved from `packages/plugins/canvas` to `packages/canvas` and renamed `@nuxflow/plugin-canvas` → `@nuxflow/canvas`
  - "Plugin" in the codebase now means exactly one thing: a signed, independently-installable dynamic Cloudflare Worker extension

  **Canvas block categories**

  - Removed `'plugin'` category; added `'forms'`, `'advanced'`, and `'commerce'` categories
  - Contact Form block promoted to `CANVAS_BLOCKS` under `'forms'`
  - HTML Block promoted to `CANVAS_BLOCKS` under `'advanced'`
  - Membership Pricing block promoted to `CANVAS_BLOCKS` under `'commerce'`
  - Block picker "Plugins" section renamed "Extensions"; only appears when true dynamic plugin blocks are installed

  **CLI scaffold template**

  - `BlockDefinition.category` updated to reflect new category set (removed `'plugin'`, added `'forms'|'advanced'|'commerce'`)
  - Example block defaults to `'advanced'` category

  **create-nuxflow-app — Linux install fix**

  - Build output moved from `dist/` to `bin/` (not gitignored)
  - `bin/index.js` is now committed so `pnpm install` inside a freshly scaffolded project can link the bin without requiring a `prepare` run first

  **DB migrations squash**

  - Migrations 0001–0008 collapsed into `0000_baseline.sql` with all `ALTER TABLE` columns folded into their `CREATE TABLE` statements
  - Clean starting point for beta

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [19df24f]
- Updated dependencies [e4d1b14]
  - @nuxflow/canvas@2.0.0-beta.2
  - @nuxflow/db@2.0.0-beta.2

## 2.0.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 1859470: feat: Argon2id password hashing, public footer/sidebar, and major dependency upgrades

  **Security — Argon2id password hashing**

  - New `workers/argon2-hasher` Cloudflare Worker: imports `argon2.wasm` statically at build time, exposes `hash` and `verify` via a service binding (`ARGON2`)
  - New `server/utils/pw.ts`: `nuxflowPasswordHasher` adapter that routes to the Argon2 binding in production and falls back to `node:crypto` scrypt in local dev
  - Better Auth `emailAndPassword.password` and setup `complete.post.ts` now use `nuxflowPasswordHasher` instead of `better-auth/crypto`
  - New `ArgonHasherBinding` type in `server/types/cloudflare-bindings.d.ts`
  - New `docs/security.md` documenting algorithm parameters and the rationale for the separate Worker architecture

  **Public layout — footer and sidebar**

  - New `PublicSiteFooter.vue`: footer navigation driven by the `footer` menu slot, hidden when the menu has no items
  - New `PublicSiteSidebar.vue`: sticky right-rail sidebar driven by the `sidebar` menu slot, hidden on mobile and when empty
  - `default.vue` layout updated to a flex-column structure that accommodates both new components

  **Setup improvements**

  - Setup wizard no longer accepts a `domain` field — the site domain is derived from the request `Host` header, eliminating the mismatch between form input and actual hostname
  - Secondary site setup (pre-created by super admin) simplified: lookup is by request host only, fallback by form domain removed
  - Menu item schema: `id` and `type` made optional so newly created items that haven't been persisted yet pass validation

  **Settings cleanup**

  - Google Analytics measurement-ID field removed from Admin → Settings → Integrations (the `integrations.analytics_id` setting key is no longer saved or loaded)

  **Dependency upgrades**

  - Vitest 3 → 4: class mock factories migrated from arrow functions to `function`/`class` syntax; `poolOptions.forks.singleFork` replaced with `maxWorkers: 1`
  - Zod 3 → 4: `z.record()` calls updated to two-arg form `z.record(z.string(), ...)` across all server routes; `schema._type` references replaced with `z.infer<typeof schema>`
  - `@nuxtjs/i18n` 9 → 10: removed `restructureDir: false` (type changed to string-only) and `lazy: true` (now default); `langDir` set to absolute path
  - `ai` 6 → 7, `@ai-sdk/openai/anthropic/google` 3 → 4, `openai` 4 → 6: no API changes required
  - `ulid` 2 → 3: drop-in replacement, no changes required
  - `stripe` 17 → 22: `customer.subscription.*` webhook type assertion updated to `as unknown as` for fields removed from SDK types
  - `@nuxt/test-utils` 3 → 4: no changes required

  **TypeScript / test compatibility fixes (surfaced by upgrades)**

  - `db.values<[string]>()` generic corrected (was `<[string][]>`, which returned the wrong nested type)
  - Non-null assertions added to `allSites[0]` accesses in multi-site middleware (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)
  - `H3Event` type assertions updated to use `as unknown as` intermediate where needed
  - `tests/helpers/globals.ts` annotated `@ts-nocheck` for globalThis property augmentation
  - `seedTier` seed helper: removed `slug` field not present in `membershipTiers` schema
  - `pages-access.test.ts`: `settings` values passed as objects, not `JSON.stringify` strings
  - Video token handler checks `response.ok` before calling `response.json()` to avoid TypeError on error bodies

- a06cd27: feat: Atom feed (/atom.xml), llms.txt route, and RSS enhancements (author, OG image, media namespace)
- 560d4eb: Add blog index, full-text search, share buttons, content excerpt/OG image, and fix CLI install on fresh clone.

  **Blog & public routes**

  - `app/pages/blog/index.vue`: paginated blog post index at `/blog`; fetches `GET /api/public/posts` with `?page` and `?limit` support.
  - `server/api/public/posts.get.ts`: new endpoint returning published posts scoped to the current site, with author, excerpt, and featured image.
  - `app/pages/search.vue`: full-text search page at `/search`; uses the existing `GET /api/v1/search` endpoint (no auth required); highlights matched terms.
  - `server/api/v1/search.get.ts`: FTS5 results now include `slug`, `title`, and `type` so the search page can link directly to content.
  - `app/components/PublicShareButtons.vue`: new share buttons component (Web Share API with Twitter/LinkedIn/copy-link fallbacks); rendered on prose content pages and taxonomy archives.
  - RSS feed (`server/routes/feed.xml.ts`): include `<content:encoded>` full HTML body and `<author>` per item.
  - Sitemap and robots.txt: include blog and taxonomy archive URLs; robots now respects the site's `seoNoindex` setting.

  **Content editor**

  - Excerpt and OG image fields added to the admin content editor sidebar (`app/pages/admin/content/[id].vue`); excerpt is used in blog listings, RSS, and OG meta; OG image can be picked from the media library.
  - `server/api/v1/content/[id].patch.ts`: accept `excerpt` and `ogImage` in the PATCH body.
  - `server/api/public/pages/[slug].get.ts`: return `author`, `excerpt`, and `ogImage` in the public page response.
  - `app/pages/[...slug].vue` and `app/pages/[taxonomySlug]/[termSlug].vue`: render author byline, featured image, and share buttons; pass `ogImage` to `useSeoMeta`.

  **Scheduled tasks**

  - `server/tasks/publish-scheduled.ts`: Nitro task wrapper for the scheduled-publish logic (required for the Nitro task system to discover and run it on schedule).

  **CLI**

  - `packages/cli/build.mjs`: new esbuild script producing a CJS bundle at `bin/nuxflow.cjs` (CJS required because `fs-extra` uses dynamic `require()` internally).
  - `bin/nuxflow.cjs` is now committed to git so `pnpm install` can create the `node_modules/.bin/nuxflow` symlink immediately — previously the symlink failed because the built file didn't exist until the `prepare` lifecycle ran (too late in pnpm's install sequence).
  - Added `prepare` script so the CLI rebuilds itself automatically on `pnpm install` (keeps `bin/nuxflow.cjs` fresh after source changes).
  - Added `files` field (`bin/`, `build.mjs`) so the compiled binary is included when the package is published to npm.
  - Scaffold template (`src/utils/scaffold.ts`): `client.ts` template now documents `definition`, `ref`, `onMounted`, full inline types for `Registry`, `VueLike`, and `BlockDefinition`, and the `BLOCK_DEFINITION` pattern for Canvas editor sidebar fields.

  **Canvas plugin**

  - `CanvasBlockHero`: responsive layout and mobile padding fixes.
  - `CanvasBlockFeatures`: icon rendering and grid alignment improvements.

- 6dc7bfa: Add Cloudflare Stream and Images credentials to the admin settings UI.

  Previously, `NUXT_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `NUXT_CLOUDFLARE_STREAM_TOKEN` had to be set as environment variables or wrangler vars before video uploads would work — there was no UI and the failure was silent (the frontend never showed an error toast because the request never began).

  - New **Settings → Media** tab with Cloudflare Stream and Cloudflare Images sections, including setup instructions and a link to where each credential is found in the Cloudflare dashboard
  - Stream token and Images token are stored encrypted at rest (AES-GCM, same as AI API keys)
  - All Cloudflare credentials (account ID, stream token, images token, delivery URL) now read from DB settings first with env var fallback — no wrangler redeploy required when credentials change
  - Refactored `getActiveProvider()` to accept an H3 event and resolve credentials via `resolveSetting()` across all 8 call sites (upload, media delete, themes, restore, WordPress import, AI image generation, site deletion)
  - Error message on unconfigured Stream now points to Settings → Media instead of a generic note

- 6c9590c: Add editorial calendar and scaffold event fields for future events system.

  - New `/admin/calendar` page with month-view grid, colour-coded content chips by status (published/scheduled/draft/review/archived), month navigation, and click-through to the content editor
  - New `GET /api/v1/content/calendar` endpoint accepting `from`/`to` date params; returns content items grouped by their publication or scheduled date
  - Calendar link added to admin sidebar between Content and Taxonomies
  - `content_items` table gains five nullable event scaffold columns (`event_start_at`, `event_end_at`, `event_location`, `event_url`, `event_all_day`) and an index on `(site_id, event_start_at)` for efficient date-range queries (migration 0006)
  - Events System section added to roadmap documenting the full planned feature and what groundwork is already in place

- 9ad2445: feat: gallery block with lightbox, EXIF extraction, image sitemap, and SEO/GEO improvements

  **Canvas — Gallery block & lightbox**

  - New `CanvasBlockGallery` block: responsive photo grid with configurable columns (2/3/4), gap, rounded corners, and optional lightbox
  - New `NuxLightbox` component: keyboard-navigable (←/→/Esc) and touch-enabled modal image viewer shared by both gallery and single image blocks
  - `CanvasBlockImage` gains a "Open lightbox on click" toggle field

  **Media**

  - EXIF extraction on JPEG/TIFF upload via new zero-dependency `server/utils/exif.ts` (reads IFD0 + ExifIFD from JPEG APP1 segments, stored in `media.metadata.exif`)
  - Image sitemap at `/sitemap-images.xml` for Google Image Search indexing

  **Blog**

  - Grid/list layout toggle on the blog index page with localStorage persistence

  **SEO & GEO**

  - Theme demo import now includes site settings (SEO, appearance, etc.) — `settings` was missing from the `what` array in both the server schema and the frontend call
  - AI Crawlers tab in Admin → SEO shows a persistent warning to check Cloudflare's "Block AI Scrapers and Crawlers" toggle, which overrides `robots.txt` at the network level

  **Performance & reliability**

  - Migration middleware gains a fast-path boolean flag (`_migrationsDone`) so already-migrated isolates skip all async overhead on subsequent requests
  - Scheduled task registration moved to unconditional lists; demo tasks guard themselves at runtime via `isDemo` config rather than at build time via `process.env`

- 1474878: feat: nightly prune task — automatically deletes audit logs beyond retention window and trims content revisions to configurable per-item limit
- bd1d5bd: Add web push notifications (VAPID) for real-time in-app alerts.

  **Server**

  - `server/utils/webpush.ts`: full VAPID implementation using Web Crypto API (no Node.js dependencies) — key generation, subscription management, and RFC 8291 encrypted payload delivery.
  - `server/api/v1/push/`: eight new endpoints: `vapid-public-key.get`, `vapid-keys.post` (generate/rotate keys), `subscribe.post`, `unsubscribe.delete`, `status.get`, `subscribers.get`, `broadcast.post`, `test.post`.
  - `server/utils/notify.ts`: `sendNotification()` now broadcasts a web push alongside the in-app notification when the site has VAPID keys configured.
  - `server/utils/settings.ts`: add `push.vapid_public_key` and `push.vapid_private_key` to `SENSITIVE_SETTING_KEYS` for encrypted-at-rest storage.
  - Push triggers wired into `contact/submit.post.ts`, `content/[id].patch.ts`, and `memberships/webhooks/[provider].post.ts`.

  **Frontend**

  - `app/composables/usePushNotifications.ts`: composable that wraps the Push API, handles permission requests, subscribes/unsubscribes, and tracks state.
  - `app/components/public/PushNotificationBanner.vue`: opt-in banner rendered on public pages.
  - `app/layouts/default.vue`: mount the banner in the default layout.
  - `app/pages/account.vue`: push notification toggle in the user account settings.
  - `app/pages/admin/settings/index.vue`: VAPID key management and broadcast UI in Admin → Settings → Notifications.
  - `public/sw.js`: service worker that handles `push` events and renders notifications via the Notifications API.

  **Database**

  - `packages/db/src/schema/system.ts`: new `push_subscriptions` table (`id`, `siteId`, `userId`, `endpoint`, `p256dh`, `auth`, `createdAt`).
  - Migration `0001_simple_sprite.sql`: `CREATE TABLE push_subscriptions` applied automatically on next deploy.

- fe571be: feat: SEO enhancements — canonical URL, focus keyword, meta robots, Google snippet preview, schema.org JSON-LD, and improved robots.txt/sitemap
- 058ca48: Add Cloudflare Stream video support, membership tier management, canvas block improvements, and wrangler dev build automation.

  **Cloudflare Stream / video**

  - `app/pages/admin/media/videos.vue`: dedicated Videos tab in the media library with TUS resumable upload support.
  - `server/api/v1/media/video/`: new video API endpoints for upload URL generation, list, and delete via the Cloudflare Stream API.
  - `packages/db/src/schema/media.ts`: add `videoAssets` table for tracking Stream-hosted videos.
  - Migrations `0002` and `0003`: schema additions applied automatically on next deploy.

  **Membership / billing**

  - `server/api/v1/memberships/index.post.ts`: create membership tiers with Stripe product and price creation.
  - `server/api/v1/memberships/[id].patch.ts`: update tier metadata and sync changes to Stripe.
  - `server/api/v1/memberships/checkout.post.ts`: Stripe Checkout session creation with configurable success/cancel URLs.
  - `server/api/v1/memberships/billing-portal.post.ts`: Stripe Customer Portal session creation.
  - `server/api/v1/memberships/webhooks/[provider].post.ts`: full Stripe webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events.

  - `packages/plugins/payments/src/components/MembershipsAdmin.vue`: tier CRUD UI with Stripe sync status.
  - `packages/plugins/payments/src/components/Paywall.vue`: subscription-aware paywall with portal link.

  **Canvas blocks**

  - `CanvasBlockImage.vue`: lazy loading, aspect-ratio preservation, and Cloudflare Images URL transformation.
  - `CanvasBlockVideo.vue`: Stream iframe embed with poster and autoplay controls.
  - `definitions.ts`: updated block schemas for GDPR, image, and video blocks.
  - `themes/default/components/blocks/Image.vue`: matching image block improvements in the default theme.

  **Content editor**

  - `ContentEditor.client.vue`: image insertion from the media library, link editing, and table support.

  **Admin UI**

  - `app/pages/admin/settings/index.vue`: expanded settings page with Stream, Stripe, and email provider sections.
  - `app/components/admin/Sidebar.vue`: Videos link in the media section.
  - `app/pages/admin/media/index.vue`: media library layout and filter improvements.

  **Tests**

  - New integration test suite: `billing-portal`, `checkout`, `media-patch`, `memberships-tiers`, `video-assets`, `webhooks`.
  - New unit test: `canvas-blocks.test.ts` covering all block definition schemas.
  - Test helpers (`event.ts`, `globals.ts`, `seed.ts`): expanded fixtures for membership and media scenarios.

  **Developer experience**

  - `wrangler.toml` / `wrangler.toml.example`: add `[build] command = "pnpm run build"` so `wrangler dev` compiles the Nuxt app automatically on first run — no separate build step required.
  - `docs/installation.md`: document the auto-build behaviour and note that source changes require a restart.

- b8b1b2c: Add Visual Customizer, content gating with Cache-Control, multi-provider payments, and theme system hardening.

  **Visual Customizer**

  - `app/pages/admin/themes/customize.vue`: new live-preview theme editor — accent colour, link colour, body/heading font, font size, heading weight, line height, border radius, and colour mode (light/dark/auto).
  - `server/api/v1/themes/customizer.get.ts`: returns current customizer values and the ID of the active customizer theme for the site.
  - `server/api/v1/themes/customizer.post.ts`: validates and saves customizer values to site settings; combines customizer CSS variables with the active bundled theme's structural CSS before writing to KV — so panel layouts and visual chrome from the bundled theme are preserved on every publish.
  - `app/plugins/theme-preview-listener.client.ts`: listens for `postMessage` events from the customizer iframe and applies CSS variables to the preview document in real time without a round-trip to the server.
  - `app/pages/admin/themes/index.vue`: "Customize" button links through to the new customizer page.

  **Theme system hardening**

  - `server/plugins/theme-resolver.ts`: added admin guard — theme CSS is no longer injected into `/admin/*` pages, preventing user-defined fonts and colours from overriding the admin dashboard UI.
  - `server/plugins/site-settings-resolver.ts`: `--nuxflow-primary` and the dark-mode blocking script continue to apply to all pages including admin for nav-bar highlights; font and custom-code injection are already admin-guarded.
  - Bundled theme packages (`nuxflow-marketing-site`, `nuxflow-marketing-landing`): replaced all hardcoded `#00dc82` and `rgba(0,220,130,…)` values with `var(--nuxflow-primary, #00dc82)` and `color-mix(in srgb, var(--nuxflow-primary, …) X%, transparent)` so the Visual Customizer's accent colour control takes full effect; also wired body font to `var(--nuxflow-font, …)` and link colour to `var(--nuxflow-link, …)`. Both ZIP bundles rebuilt.

  **Content gating and Cache-Control**

  - `server/api/public/pages/[slug].get.ts`: HTTP 402 with `{ gated, requiredTier, tiers }` when content requires a subscription the caller does not hold; `Cache-Control: private, no-store` on member-only responses; `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400` on public responses.
  - `server/utils/payments/gate.ts`: `resolveContentGate(event, settings)` checks `settings.access` (`'public'`, `'members'`, `'tier:<id>'`) against the caller's active subscription. Returns `GateResult | null` (null = access granted).
  - `app/pages/[...slug].vue`: `onResponseError` handler catches the 402 and renders `<Paywall :tiers="gated.tiers" />` instead of the page content.

  **Multi-provider payment system (moved to core)**

  - `server/utils/payments/stripe.ts`: Stripe provider — products, prices, checkout sessions, billing portal, subscription cancel, webhook event construction.
  - `server/utils/payments/lemonsqueezy.ts`: LemonSqueezy provider — products, variants, checkout, portal, cancellation, webhook HMAC verification.
  - `server/utils/payments/paddle.ts`: Paddle Classic provider with analogous interface.
  - `server/api/v1/memberships/`: checkout, billing-portal, webhooks, tier CRUD, and tier patch endpoints updated to use the new provider abstraction.
  - `server/api/v1/account/subscription.delete.ts`: cancel the caller's active subscription; skips provider API for free-tier subs whose `providerSubscriptionId` starts with `free_`.
  - `app/components/memberships/Paywall.vue`: subscription-aware paywall with upgrade CTA and portal link.
  - `app/components/memberships/MembershipsAdmin.vue`: tier CRUD UI.
  - `app/pages/account.vue`: subscription management page — active plan, billing portal link, cancel flow.
  - `packages/plugins/payments/src/index.ts`: simplified to a deprecated stub kept for workspace compatibility; functionality lives in `server/utils/payments/`.

  **Contact form and HTML block (moved to core)**

  - `app/components/forms/ContactFormAdmin.vue`, `ContactFormBlock.vue`: contact form UI components moved into the main app so they render without the plugin being active.
  - `app/components/blocks/HtmlBlock.vue`: HTML block renderer moved to core.
  - `packages/plugins/contact-form/src/index.ts`, `packages/plugins/html-block/src/index.ts`: simplified to plugin registration stubs; component logic lives in the app.

  **Analytics**

  - `server/utils/analytics.ts`: `trackPageView(event, { siteId, slug })` writes to the Cloudflare Analytics Engine binding; no-ops silently when the binding is absent. Called automatically from the public pages API.

  **DB schema (migrations 0004 and 0005)**

  - `packages/db/src/schema/content.ts`: additional content type metadata columns.
  - `packages/db/src/schema/system.ts`: `rate_limits` table and extended plugin/audit columns.
  - Migrations applied automatically on first request after deployment.

  **Canvas**

  - `packages/plugins/canvas/src/blocks/CanvasBlockFooter.vue`: layout and link colour fixes.

  **Integration tests**

  - `tests/integration/customizer.test.ts`: publish flow, base-theme layering, re-publish idempotency.
  - `tests/integration/public-site.test.ts`: public page fetch, 402 for gated content, Cache-Control headers.
  - `tests/integration/subscription-cancel.test.ts`: cancel flow for paid and free-tier subscriptions.
  - `tests/integration/pages-access.test.ts`: Cache-Control ordering fix — tests that depend on a seeded subscription now run after the subscription is created.

  **Documentation and developer experience**

  - `docs/installation.md`: corrected Cloudflare deploy command to `cd apps/nuxflow && pnpm run deploy` (Wrangler's `[build]` section handles the Nuxt build automatically; the previous `pnpm deploy` from the repo root conflicted with Turbo's own build step).
  - `docs/payments-setup.md`: new guide covering Stripe, LemonSqueezy, and Paddle setup including webhook endpoints and required secrets.
  - `docs/roadmap.md`: public roadmap.
  - `docs/user-guide.md`: Visual Customizer, content gating, membership management, and account page sections.
  - `CLAUDE.md`: updated deploy command reference.

### Patch Changes

- 1958b5e: feat: add customizable membership pricing block and option to pause signups

  - **Membership Pricing Block**: Introduced the dynamic `payments/memberships` Canvas block (`MembershipsBlock.vue`) which replaces the hardcoded `pricing.vue` page. It fetches active tiers from the database and supports customizable CTA, titles, and popular tier highlighting.
  - **Pause Signups Setting**: Added a configuration setting in Admin Settings to pause new memberships checkouts, with customizable display messages.
  - **Checkout Enforcement**: Added validation to the checkout endpoint to block requests with a 403 status when signups are disabled.
  - **Paywall error handling**: Implemented toast notifications for paywall checkout errors.
  - **Stripe & Webhook Updates**: Added HMAC signature logging in Stripe webhooks and verified webhook parsing. Added `no-console` ESLint overrides for webhook tracing.
  - **Documentation**: Updated payments setup guide with Canvas block instructions and Stripe Sandbox troubleshooting.

- 4f56e71: feat: scaffold SMS support — phone field on users table, SMS provider credentials registered as encrypted sensitive settings
- 9bbf35c: feat: show unconfigured banner and disable upload button on video page when Cloudflare Stream credentials are missing
- 7c28645: Fix Linux build OOM crash by setting NODE_OPTIONS heap limit via cross-env

  Nitro's cloudflare-module bundle step exhausts the default V8 heap (~2 GB) on Linux. Added `cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` to the build script so both Linux and Windows deployments use a 4 GB heap cap without requiring a manually set environment variable.

  Also adds a Linux permission error note to the installation quickstart docs.

- 9f7fbbd: Fix `state_mismatch` error on social login for secondary custom domains.

  **Root cause:** The Better Auth instance was created once at module load time with a hardcoded `baseURL` from `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. OAuth callbacks on secondary domains (e.g. `customerdomain.com`) had their `redirect_uri` set to the primary domain, causing Google/GitHub to reject the state token.

  **Auth fixes**

  - `server/utils/better-auth.ts`: new shared utility that builds a Better Auth instance per isolate with a 5-minute TTL. In production it loads all site domains from the DB and passes `{ allowedHosts, protocol: 'https', fallback }` as `baseURL` so Better Auth resolves the correct `redirect_uri` from the incoming `Host` header on every OAuth request.
  - `server/middleware/04.auth-override.ts`: new middleware that intercepts all `/api/auth/**` requests before any route handler runs, guaranteeing our instance (not the module's hardcoded one) handles every auth request.
  - `server/api/auth/[...all].ts`: updated to delegate to the shared utility.
  - `app/auth.config.ts`: fixed client-side `baseURL` resolution — `window.location.origin` is now checked first on the browser so the auth client on a secondary domain sends requests to that domain rather than the baked-in `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

  **Docs**

  - `docs/installation.md`: clarify that `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is a `[vars]` entry in `wrangler.toml`, not a `wrangler secret put` secret; add multi-domain note to Google OAuth callback URI setup.
  - `docs/multi-site.md`: new "Social login on custom domains" section explaining per-domain callback URI registration for Google and the limitation of GitHub OAuth (single callback URL per app).

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 428031e: feat: add AI content generation and translation suite

  - Integrated OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek AI providers.
  - Added AI content tools for grammar correction, translation, SEO suggestions, and bulk alt-text generation.
  - Added AI generation modals in the Canvas Editor.
  - Updated settings UI for configuring AI provider API keys.
  - Handled UI updates for media library alt text generation.

- 4698a81: Add membership, auth, and public-facing pages; introduce 3-layer test suite; fix Cloudflare 522 registration timeout.

  **New pages:** `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/pricing`, `/account` — all using the `auth` layout with glass-card styling.

  **Registration fix:** The `POST /api/public/auth/register` handler previously made a self-referencing HTTP call to Better Auth's sign-up endpoint, which causes a Cloudflare 522 connection-timeout when a Worker tries to fetch itself. The handler now creates the user and credential account directly in the database using `hashPassword` from `better-auth/crypto`, matching the setup wizard's approach. A new `GET /api/public/auth/registration-status` endpoint lets the register page check whether public registration is enabled before showing the form, so users are not presented with a form they cannot submit.

  **Content gating:** `GET /api/public/pages/[slug]` now enforces visibility rules (`public`, `members`, `private`, `tier:<id>`) and returns structured 402 payloads with available tier data.

  **Test suite:** Added a 3-layer test infrastructure — 10 unit test files (Vitest, pure logic), 5 integration test files (real in-memory SQLite via libSQL), and 3 Playwright E2E specs with a global setup that seeds a test site. New scripts: `test:integration`, `test:all`, `test:e2e`.

- 4f1621b: Add social login (Google/GitHub) with account linking, fix OAuth account-insert schema gap, and apply security hardening.

  **Social login & account linking**

  - `auth.config.ts`: fix `accountLinking` config key path (`accountLinking` → `account.accountLinking`) so `trustedProviders` is actually read by Better Auth; add `requireLocalEmailVerified: false` so onboarding-created admins can auto-link without email verification
  - `setup/complete.post.ts`: set `emailVerified: true` for the onboarding admin user (they proved ownership by running the wizard)
  - New `AdminLinkedAccountsManager.vue` component: shows email/password and OAuth provider rows, connect/disconnect buttons, safety guard against removing last auth method
  - `admin/settings/index.vue`: add LinkedAccountsManager to Security tab; deep-link to tab via `?tab=` query param after OAuth callback
  - `login.vue` and `register.vue`: handle `?error=` query params from Better Auth OAuth callbacks with user-friendly messages; add Google/GitHub buttons to register page

  **DB schema fix**

  - `packages/db/src/schema/users.ts`: add `accessTokenExpiresAt`, `refreshTokenExpiresAt`, `scope` columns to the `accounts` table — Better Auth v1.6.14 inserts these on every OAuth account creation; their absence caused `unable_to_link_account` on first Google sign-in
  - Migration `0004_faithful_centennial.sql`: three nullable `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` statements applied automatically on next deploy

  **Security hardening**

  - `theme-resolver.ts`: strip `</style>` tags from KV-stored CSS before SSR injection
  - `site-settings-resolver.ts`: validate primary colour against CSS allowlist regex; restrict font to known-good allowlist before injecting Google Fonts link
  - `03.api-key-auth.ts`: scope API key lookup to `event.context.siteId` so keys from one site cannot authenticate against another
  - `mcp.ts`: add role checks to `create_content` and `update_content` tools (author+ to create, editor+ to publish)
  - `comments.get.ts`: strip `guestEmail` from public comment responses
  - `preview/[token].get.ts`: query by `previewToken` column instead of `id`; add `siteId` scope and expiry check
  - `seed-test-pages.get.ts`: restrict to `NODE_ENV=development` and require super admin auth

  **Docs**

  - `docs/installation.md`: Social Login section with step-by-step Google and GitHub OAuth setup, required secrets, callback URIs, build-time env var reminder
  - `docs/user-guide.md`: Social Login & Account Linking section covering new-user signup, post-onboarding auto-linking, manual linking from Settings, and error message reference

### Patch Changes

- a03f004: fix: resolve pnpm hoisting issues for ESLint and Better Auth

  - Set `shamefully-hoist=true` in `.npmrc` to guarantee strict module resolution for Nuxt ESLint config.
  - Pinned `kysely` to `0.28.5` via `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` to prevent `@better-auth` from crashing during the Cloudflare Nitro build process when `kysely` v0.29 is improperly hoisted.

- dc90543: Fix SSR relative fetch host context issue inside the setup guard route middleware to ensure onboarding setup is loaded successfully on secondary site custom domains. Clean up explicit any type-casts in super admin sites dashboard forms.
- bdb5f1e: Implement security enhancements (SSRF protection for backups/imports, Zip bomb/slip validation for restore operations) and edge rate-limiting optimizations using Cloudflare KV/Memory cache. Add new interactive Canvas blocks (Accordion, Button, Pricing) and update Contact Form block dependencies.
