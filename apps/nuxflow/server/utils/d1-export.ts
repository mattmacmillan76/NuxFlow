// Whole-D1-instance SQL dump — not the per-site JSON backup in backup.ts. `wrangler d1
// export` is a CLI-only tool (it shells out to Cloudflare's API from the developer's
// machine, not something a live Worker can invoke), so this reimplements the same idea
// from inside a request: introspect the database's actual schema via sqlite_master and
// emit a portable, restorable .sql file. Every site's data comes back in one file — this
// is a database-level backup, not a site-level one — which is why the only caller
// (server/api/v1/admin/db-export.get.ts) gates it behind requireSuperAdmin, not the
// site-scoped requireRole() the per-site backup route uses.
//
// Deliberately avoids PRAGMA entirely, even the subset Cloudflare's own docs list as
// supported (table_info, foreign_key_list — https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/sql-api/sql-statements/).
// Both were tried here first and both 500'd against a real deployment with
// `D1_ERROR: not authorized: SQLITE_AUTH` when run inside a `d1.batch()` call — D1's
// authorizer rejects them in that context even though the docs list them as supported
// standalone, and this only surfaced against real D1 (wrangler dev's local D1 emulation
// accepted them fine). Rather than keep the file's two other genuinely necessary pieces
// of PRAGMA-derived data (table dependency order, column names) tied to a call D1
// silently rejects under batching, both are now derived without PRAGMA at all: dependency
// order falls back to whatever order sqlite_master already returns tables in (correctness
// never depended on real ordering here anyway — see the transaction-wrapping comment
// below), and column names come from the keys of each table's own first returned row.
//
// Also deliberately avoids d1.batch() for row data, for the same "found out against a
// real deployment" reason: batching every table's full SELECT together made D1 hold
// every table's complete result set in its own isolate's memory at once, which 500'd with
// "D1 DB's isolate exceeded its memory limit and was reset" against real production data
// (never reproduced locally — a fresh/empty local dev database has nothing to reproduce it
// with). Fetched one table at a time instead, paginated (LIMIT/OFFSET).
//
// Page size is *adaptive*, not fixed: a first attempt at 1000 rows/page still hit the same
// isolate-memory error on `content_items` alone (offset 0 — i.e. this schema has at least
// one table whose rows are large enough that even one page of 1000 overflows D1's 128 MB
// per-isolate ceiling for materializing a query result — Cloudflare doesn't document an
// explicit row-count-per-query limit, only a 2 MB max row size and that 128 MB isolate
// cap). Rather than guess a fixed number small enough for every possible deployment (and
// risk being needlessly slow for one with small rows, or still wrong for one with larger
// ones), the per-table fetch loop below halves the page size and retries the same offset
// whenever D1 reports an isolate-memory rejection specifically, down to a floor of 10
// rows. D1 also caps a paid plan at 1,000 queries per Worker invocation total (not per
// table) — tracked here via a shared budget across every table, so a very large database
// fails with a clear message pointing at the CLI tool instead of silently running out
// mid-export.
//
// **Streaming, not buffering.** Fixing the isolate-memory error above (D1's own per-query
// ceiling) surfaced a *different* one on the next real deploy: "Worker exceeded memory
// limit" — this Worker's own isolate memory cap, completely separate from D1's. The
// earlier version fetched pages correctly but still pushed every generated INSERT
// statement into one `parts: string[]` for the *entire database* and returned it all as
// one string once every table was done — so a real deployment's total dump size (easily
// hundreds of MB of SQL text once escaped/hex-encoded) blew this Worker's own memory
// ceiling regardless of how carefully the D1 side was paginated. `streamD1TableData()`
// below fixes this by writing each generated chunk out via a caller-supplied `write()`
// callback immediately, never holding more than one page's worth of rows/SQL text at a
// time — `server/api/v1/admin/db-export.get.ts` wires that callback straight to the HTTP
// response body (the same TransformStream + sendStream() pattern already used by
// wordpress.post.ts's import progress stream) so bytes reach the client as they're
// produced instead of accumulating here. `generateD1SqlDump()` further below is a
// buffering convenience wrapper around the same two functions, kept for tests and any
// caller that actually wants the whole dump as one string — it reintroduces the exact
// memory-accumulation problem described above, so it must never be used by the live HTTP
// export route.
